Questions:

KALI - Confirm memory is 4 GB

WEB01: Why did we get an NT Authority shell?
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ curl http://10.10.14.20/shell.php?cmd=whoami
1       nt authority\system

WEB02: 
nc.exe command copy to the current directory is not in pentesting report. This is because it was expected to already be in the directory however we should not assume this.
I didn't sign in as Betty
Before getting NT Authority, are we able to check the MP preference to see which directories have an exclusion? Are we able to set an exclusion?
Confirm that registry download works

DMZ01: 
Before getting NT Authority, are we able to read Chris' PowerShell history file?


When we get Helen's password can we automatically connect to ADMIN02 or ADMIN01 given that Helen is a local admin on them?


ERROR: A required privilege is not held by the client.
Why is a required privilege not held? Was this a fluke? Or does WEB02 need to be rebooted and re-backed-up?


Overall: Are there any computers that we need to take actions on after they are already booted?

How can we separate Daniela and Ernesto into 2 different computers, so there's no setup after booting the VMs.
