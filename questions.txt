Questions:

KALI - Confirm memory is 4 GB

WEB01: Why did we get an NT Authority shell?
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ curl http://10.10.14.20/shell.php?cmd=whoami
1       nt authority\system
        3


WEB02: 

Problem: I didn't sign in as Betty

Question 1: Before getting NT Authority, are we able to check the MP preference to see which directories have an exclusion? Are we able to set an exclusion?
Question 2: nc.exe command copy to the current directory is not in pentesting report. This is because it was expected to already be in the directory. Is this best practice? Should I remove the python3 http server or put at the top of the command "you only need to start this if you don't already have a server started"?

DMZ01: 
Question 1:Before getting NT Authority, are we able to read Chris' PowerShell history file?
When we get Helen's password can we automatically connect to ADMIN02 or ADMIN01 given that Helen is a local admin on them?

MAIL01: Problem: Smart Host was set to 10.10.14.80




Overall: Are there any computers that we need to take actions on after they are already booted?

Pentest Report Modifications

DEV01: Can we enable Apache and MySQL when we have a reverse shell as Daniela? (add to pentest report)
How can we separate Daniela and Ernesto into 2 different computers, so there's no setup after booting the VMs.

Afterward: 
DC01 - Run to make sure the 2 prompts at the beginning work
