When creating the new virtual machines in VMWare, set the encryption password to password123!!
(this will allow you to start up the VMs on a different device)

In the Virtual Machine Settings, Under "Device status", enable "Connect at power on". This is required to boot from the ISO image.

Step 1: Initialize Domain Controller
- Ensure only 1 (VMNet1) Network Adapter is Set in VMWare.
- Continue running the DC01.ps1 script after reboots.
- When the setup is complete, the script will output "Setup Complete".
- Once the setup is complete, you can add a second (NAT) network adapter and sync the DC with an external time source
- Ensure the Domain Controller continues to run at all times


Step 2: Initialize Kali
1. Open "Virtual Network Editor" from the VMWare "Edit" menu. Click "Change Settings" and confirm the UAC prompt. Set the bridged network adapter to bridge to your ethernet controller and click "OK". Ensure an ethernet cable is connected. This will allow file sharing with your host through a samba share.
2. Boot Kali, set up, and start a Samba Share, following the documentation in KALI.txt
3. Transfer Instructions.docx and powershell.lnk to Kali
4. Run the setup script (KALI.sh)
5. Update /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/resolv.conf, following the documentation in KALI.txt
6. Shut down Kali, change the network adapter to VMNet1, and start Kali again.
7. Confirm Connectivity to the domain controller, following the documentation in KALI.txt


Step 3: Join Member Workstations to the Domain using domain-join.ps1 PowerShell script

1. Ensure the Windows 11 Enterprise VM is fully updated
2. Ensure VMWare Tools is installed
3. Ensure the first network adapter is set to VMNet1 and the second network adapter is set to NAT
4. Ensure tamper protection is disabled, and the computer is set to never go to sleep.
5. Here are the computer names and corresponding IP addresses. You will input these when running the domain-join.ps1 script.
Computer names and corresponding host IPs:
WEB01 - 10.10.14.20                    Log in as: Aaron: tt.r.2006 (Local Admin)
WEB02 - 10.10.14.40                    Log in as: iis_service: daisy_3 (Local Admin); Betty: pinky.1995 (Standard User)
DMZ01 - 10.10.14.60                    Log in as: Chris: abcABC123!@# (Local Admin)
MAIL01 - 10.10.14.80                   Log in as: Daniela: c/o2010 (Local Admin)
DEV01 - 10.10.14.100                   Log in as: Ernesto: lucky#1 (Local Admin); Daniela: c/o2010 (Standard User)
ADMIN04 - 10.10.14.120                 Log in as: Francesca: bubbelinbunny_1 (Local Admin)
ADMIN03 - 10.10.14.140                 Log in as: Francesca: bubbelinbunny_1 (Local Admin)
ADMIN02 - 10.10.14.160                 Log in as: Helen: chase#1 (Local Admin)
ADMIN01 - 10.10.14.180                 Log in as: Helen: chase#1 (Local Admin)
FILES01 - 10.10.14.200                 Log in as: Issac: passw0rd!! (Local Admin)
6. To make a user a local admin, open an elevated PowerShell (using Domain Admin credentials in the UAC prompt), and run the following command
net localgroup Administrators /add ad\[User]
7. Then restart the computer. You can now open an elevated PowerShell session, as the user is a member of the Local Administrations group.


Step 4: Set up Attack Boxes using their PowerShell scripts

1. Make sure Windows Security is initialized, then run the scripts
2. Then make sure Windows Defender Exclusions were successfully applied on the following computers (WEB01, WEB02, DMZ01, DEV01, ADMIN01)
3. WEB02.ps1 needs to be run a second time, after the computer reboots.
4. WEB02 - Log in as Betty, to cache a domain credential.
5. DEV01 - After running DEV01.ps1, log in as Daniela and run DEV01-Part2.ps1
6. ADMIN02 - Download Instructions.docx to Helen's home directory, prior to running script
